# Satguru AI Central Portal

Satguru AI Central Portal is a Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS MVP foundation for `https://app.satguruai.com`. It is designed as a database-backed internal application hub, not a static link page.

## Phase 1 MVP included

- Public pages: Home, About, Tools preview, Contact
- Auth-ready pages: Login, Signup, Verify OTP, Forgot password
- Logged-in experience: Dashboard, portal directory, portal detail pages, profile, favorites, support form
- Admin console: overview, users, portals, allowed domains, categories, documents, announcements, support, settings
- Database-ready mock registry in `lib/data.ts`
- PostgreSQL schema and seed data in `database/`
- Vercel root-domain redirects in `vercel.json`
- Environment variable template in `.env.example`

## Not included yet

- Full cross-portal SSO
- AI assistant and document Q&A
- Production Supabase authentication provider wiring
- File upload storage implementation
- Advanced analytics dashboards

The data model and UI are structured so these can be added in later phases.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 LTS or newer
- npm 10 or newer
- PostgreSQL or Supabase project for the later database integration step

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build and lint

```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
```

If dependency installation fails because the npm registry is blocked by the execution environment, run the same commands in a network-enabled local shell or CI runner.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure Supabase/PostgreSQL, email, storage, auth, and future AI provider settings. The current MVP keeps mock data in `lib/data.ts`, so Supabase credentials are not required to render the pages yet.

## Database

Run `database/schema.sql` in PostgreSQL/Supabase, then `database/seed.sql` to create the initial approved domains, categories, departments, announcements, and 13 initial portal records.

## Implemented routes

### Public and auth-ready routes

- `/`
- `/about`
- `/tools`
- `/contact`
- `/login`
- `/signup`
- `/verify-otp`
- `/forgot-password`

### User routes

- `/dashboard`
- `/portals`
- `/portals/[slug]`
- `/profile`
- `/favorites`
- `/support`

### Admin routes

- `/admin`
- `/admin/users`
- `/admin/portals`
- `/admin/domains`
- `/admin/categories`
- `/admin/documents`
- `/admin/announcements`
- `/admin/support`
- `/admin/settings`

## Architecture notes

- Frontend cards are rendered from `lib/data.ts`, which mirrors the database schema and should be replaced by Supabase service functions when credentials are configured.
- Admin screens are management-ready placeholders that show database-backed tables and intended actions.
- Auth pages are OTP-ready and document approved email domain policy.
- Dashboard/admin routes include a middleware protection scaffold and must be connected to real auth/session checks when the auth provider is implemented.
- Vercel redirects in `vercel.json` assume `satguruai.com`, `www.satguruai.com`, and `app.satguruai.com` are attached to the Vercel project.
